# Case Studies

This repository contains my case studies exploring **software sustainability, architecture choices, and reducing long-term technical debt**.  

Each study looks at patterns, trade-offs, and industry trends that affect software maintenance, scalability, and developer experience.  

📖 Full case studies are available in the **[Wiki](../../wiki)**.
